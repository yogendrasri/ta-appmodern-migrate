### Binary project
This binary project does not contain source code and therefore does not allow you to make changes to your application before it is migrated. The application binary and application dependencies uploaded to Transformation Advisor are included here and will be used when building the Liberty based image for your application. If you provided Maven coordinates for the application binary and dependencies, they will be downloaded from the given Maven repository before building the image.
 
 ### How the bundle helps with modernization
 
  - Provides files that are necessary for containerization, accelerating the deployment to Liberty.
  
  - Provides the resources necessary to deploy your application to an OpenShift cluster using an operator.
- Tests how your application works in a container and deployed to a cluster, without neeing access to the application's source code (provided no changes are required for a successful migration).

 ### Documentation & support
 For more information and instructions on how to use this software see the IBM Knowledge Center [manual link](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS5Q6W/welcome.html). 

To build and deploy using Accelerator for Teams - go to the migration plan page in Transformation Advisor and select the option to use Accelerator for Teams, before downloading or pushing the bundle to Git. Accelerator for Teams was derived from the Kabanero.io software, for more details on using this feature see [Kabanero.io documentation](https://kabanero.io/docs/).
